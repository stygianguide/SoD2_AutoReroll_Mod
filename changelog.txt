Version 1.1.0
The mod now includes a UI, eliminating the need to configure a text file, though the old file format remains fully compatible and can be used to alter default values at startup. Selecting the game window is no longer necessary. The console is optional for exhaustive debugging. Added the ability to lock certain character positions to prevent the mod from rerolling them.
